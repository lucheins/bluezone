Thanks to *Jeremy Feinstein* for his work with this repo: https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu and a special thanks to *Martin Guillon* for helping me out.


### NOTICE: The below API method calls are often called something with window. The is only to keep parity with the iOS version of this module. Please remember that this Android version uses views and not windows.


## Get the module

**Find the newest version in the dist folder**

## Referencing the module in your Ti mobile application 

Simply add the following lines to your `tiapp.xml` file:
    
    <modules>
        <module platform="android">dk.napp.drawer</module> 
    </modules>


## Reference

For more detailed code examples take a look into the example app.

For Alloy projects, use the [nl.fokkezb.drawer](https://github.com/fokkezb/nl.fokkezb.drawer) widget.

### centerWindow, leftWindow, rightWindow

Napp Drawer does not require you to use the 3 views. You can also use either the combo of center/left or center/right for your desired needs. 

```javascript
var NappDrawerModule = require('dk.napp.drawer');
var mainWindow = NappDrawerModule.createDrawer({
	fullscreen:false, 
	leftWindow: leftMenuView,
	centerWindow: centerView,
	rightWindow: rightMenuView,
	fading: 0.2, // 0-1
	parallaxAmount: 0.2, //0-1
	shadowWidth:"40dp", 
	leftDrawerWidth: "200dp",
	rightDrawerWidth: "200dp",
	animationMode: NappDrawerModule.ANIMATION_NONE,
	closeDrawerGestureMode: NappDrawerModule.CLOSE_MODE_MARGIN,
	openDrawerGestureMode: NappDrawerModule.OPEN_MODE_ALL,
	orientationModes: [Ti.UI.PORTRAIT, Ti.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT]
});
```

*NOTE:* As result of a limitation in the underlying library you cannot set `leftDrawerWidth` and `rightDrawerWidth` independently. [Track this issue here](https://github.com/viezel/NappDrawer/issues/77).

## API Properties

```

| input (constant) | Description | 
| ----- | ----------- |

| OPEN_MODE_MARGIN | The user can open the drawer by a swipe gesture on the screen's margin. | 
| OPEN_MODE_ALL | The user can open the drawer by a swipe gesture anywhere on the screen. |

```

| input (constant) | Description |

```javascript
mainWindow.setShadowWidth("40dp");
```


### ParallaxAmount

Parallax is the amount of parallax between the centerView and a sideView animation. Set a value between 0 and 1. Its a very cool effect. Play with the slider in the example code to see the effect!

```javascript
mainWindow.setParallaxAmount(0.3);
```

```javascript
mainWindow.setFading(0.3);

```javascript
mainWindow.setOrientationModes([Ti.UI.PORTRAIT, Ti.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT]);
```
