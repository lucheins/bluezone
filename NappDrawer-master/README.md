# Napp Drawer Module

## Description

The Napp Drawer module extends the Appcelerator Titanium Mobile framework. 
The module is licensed under the MIT license.

There are **some minor platform parity differences** in this module. iOS version uses Windows whereas Android uses views. The android version still uses the same properties even though its views rather than windows, e.g. `isAnyWindowOpen()` is the exact same method call on each platform.
